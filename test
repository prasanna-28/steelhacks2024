\section*{Sets}

\textbf{Natural numbers} are represented by the set:
$$\mathbb{N} = \{0, 1, 2, ...\}$$

\textbf{Integers} are represented by the set:
$$\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\}$$

\textbf{Rational numbers} are represented by the set:
$$\mathbb{Q} = \left\{ \frac{k}{n} \mid k \in \mathbb{Z}, n \in \mathbb{N}, n \neq 0 \right\}$$

\textbf{Real numbers} are represented by the set $\mathbb{R}$.

\textbf{Complex numbers} are represented by the set:
$$\mathbb{C} = \{a + ib \mid a, b \in \mathbb{R}\}$$
where $i$ is the \textit{imaginary unit}, characterized by $i^2 = -1$.

$d$-dimensional space over $\mathbb{R}$ is:
$$\mathbb{R}^d = \{(a_1, ..., a_d) \mid a_i \in \mathbb{R}\}$$

The space of infinite sequences of real numbers is:
$$\mathbb{R}^\infty = \{(a_0, a_1, a_2, ...) \mid a_i \in \mathbb{R}\}$$

\section*{Set Operations}

Given two sets $A$ and $B$:

\textbf{Union:} The union of $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \cup B$, is the set of all elements that are in $A$, in $B$, or in both.
$$A \cup B = \{c \mid c \in A \text{ or } c \in B\}$$

\textbf{Intersection:} The intersection of $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \cap B$, is the set of all elements that are in both $A$ and $B$.
$$A \cap B = \{c \mid c \in A \text{ and } c \in B\}$$

\textbf{Difference:} The difference of $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \setminus B$, is the set of all elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$.
$$A \setminus B = \{c \in A \mid c \notin B\}$$

\textbf{Symmetric Difference:} The symmetric difference of $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \Delta B$, can be expressed in the following ways:
\begin{align*}
A \Delta B &= A \setminus B \cup B \setminus A \\
&= (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)
\end{align*}

\section*{Indexed Families of Sets}

Let $(A_\alpha)_{\alpha \in I}$ be an indexed family of sets, with index set $I$.

\textbf{Union:} The union of the family, denoted $\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_\alpha$, is:
$$\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_\alpha = \{\alpha \mid a \in A_\alpha \text{ for some } \alpha \in I\}$$
This can also be expressed as:
$$\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_\alpha = \{a \mid \exists \alpha \in I \text{ such that } a \in A_\alpha\}$$

\textbf{Intersection:} The intersection of the family, denoted $\bigcap_{\alpha \in I} A_\alpha$, is:
$$\bigcap_{\alpha \in I} A_\alpha = \{a \mid a \in A_\alpha \text{ for every } \alpha \in I\}$$
This can also be expressed as:
$$\bigcap_{\alpha \in I} A_\alpha = \{a \mid \forall \alpha \in I, a \in A_\alpha\}$$

\section*{Maps}

A \textbf{map} (also called a \textit{function}, \textit{mapping}, or \textit{transformation}) is a rule that assigns a unique output to each input.

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. A map $f$ from $A$ to $B$, denoted $f: A \to B$, is an assignment such that for every element $a \in A$, there exists a unique element $b \in B$, called the \textit{value of} $f$ \textit{at} $a$ and denoted by $f(a)$.

\textbf{Note:} While $f$ assigns a value to every element in $A$, there may exist elements in $B$ that are not mapped to by any element in $A$. 

\textbf{Domain and Target Space:} Given a map $f: A \to B$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $A$ is called the \textit{domain} of $f$.
\item $B$ is called the \textit{target space} of $f$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Restriction:} If $A' \subseteq A$, then the \textit{restriction} of $f$ to $A'$, denoted by $f' = f|_{A'}$, is the map $f': A' \to B$ defined by $f'(a) = f(a)$ for all $a \in A'$.

\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto \sin(x)$. This map is often written as $f = \sin$.

\item $f: \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto \frac{1}{x}$.

\item $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, $x \mapsto \begin{cases}
x^2 & \text{if } x \neq 0, \\
1 & \text{if } x = 0.
\end{cases}$

\item $f: V \to \{\text{set of subspaces of } V\}$, $v \mapsto \text{span}(v)$, where $V$ is a vector space.

\item $D: P(\mathbb{R}) \to P(\mathbb{R})$, $p(x) \mapsto p'(x)$, where $P(\mathbb{R})$ is the set of polynomials with real coefficients and $p'(x)$ is the derivative of $p(x)$.
\end{enumerate}
